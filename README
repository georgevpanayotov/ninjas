Ninjas: Versioning the config files used for various utilities.

Installation:

./install


Extensibility:
Additional configs can be loaded by putting a directory into
.ninjas/

For instance:
.ninjas/package

The following files can be added to the package

    zshrc # Sourced in .zshrc
    prezshrc # Sourced in .zshrc before all of the other zshrcs. Helpful, to preload some state that
             # might impact the default package.
    zshenv # Sourced in .zshenv
    gitconfig # Included in .gitconfig
    hgrc # Included in .hgrc
    vimpaths # Each line is added to vim's runtimepath

The following folders can be added to the package

    bin # Added to $PATH
    vim # Added to vim's runtimepath
    zshfn # Added to fpath

The first package to be loaded will be the "default" package that lives in the ninjas repo.
